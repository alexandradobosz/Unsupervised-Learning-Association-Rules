# Unsupervised-Learning-Association-Rules
This project is my second exploration of unsupervised learning techniques, completed during the first semester of my first year of Data Science and Business Analytics studies at the University of Warsaw.
This project aimed to apply unsupervised learning techniques, specifically association rule mining using the Apriori algorithm, to the Census Income Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal was to uncover hidden relationships between demographic, occupational, and financial attributes, focusing on identifying patterns related to income levels (<=50K and >50K).
